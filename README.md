  Div Acer Manager Max
</h1>

**Div Acer Manager Max** is a feature-rich Linux GUI utility for Acer laptops powered by the incredible [Linuwu Sense](https://github.com/0x7375646F/Linuwu-Sense) drivers. It replicates and expands on Acer’s NitroSense capabilities on Linux with full fan control, performance modes, battery optimization, backlight settings, and more — all wrapped in a modern Avalonia-based UI.

> ⚠️ **Project is under active development.**
