**AcerSense** is the ***reworked*** version of the original [DAMX](https://github.com/PXDiv/Div-Acer-Manager-Max) by PXDiv, which is a Linux GUI for Acer laptops using Linuwu Sense drivers ‚Äî all wrapped in a modern Avalonia-based UI. This is a replicates of NitroSense and PredatorSense but for Linux!

## ‚ùì Why "Rework"

- Uh,... It is just my sudden inspiration. After finding a lot of 'NitroSense for Linux' in the internet, I found that every tools/drivers are not supported for my model. Even I edited the [linuwu_sense](https://github.com/0x7375646F/Linuwu-Sense/blob/main/src/linuwu_sense.c) to make the DMI matched with my device, Linuwu Sense still not supported my device. After read the README, I found that a GUI tool called DAMX that can supported my device by edit the modified version of [linuwu_sense](https://github.com/PXDiv/Div-Linuwu-Sense) (PXDiv). But the UI is too bad for me so I fork his project and modify a bit.
